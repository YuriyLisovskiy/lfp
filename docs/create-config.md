## Configuration keywords explained here

[LFP](https://github.com/YuriyLisovskiy/lfp) supports `yaml`, `json` and `xml` config file formats.
See [examples](../sample).
    
> *See license requirements for filed necessity. The default license notice template
requires `years`, `authors` and `license` fields.

Create a file, for example [`config.yml`](../sample/config.yml).
> Keywords can be added in any other order.
