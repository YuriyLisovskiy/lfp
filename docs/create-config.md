## Configuration keywords explained here

Currently [LFP](https://github.com/YuriyLisovskiy/lfp) supports only yaml config file format.
    
> *See license requirements for filed necessity. The default license notice template
requires <years>, <authors> and <license> fields.

Create a file, for example [`config.yml`](../sample/config.yml).
> Keywords can be added in any other order.
